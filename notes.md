# Building communities with open source internship programs

Useful source material: [https://github.com/intermine/internships](https://github.com/intermine/internships)  



Opening question 1: Have you ever been an intern or supervised an intern? What (if anything!) made it memorable?

   *  Yes if you count supervising a Google Summer of Code Student. Seeing my first student become an established researcher and regular open source contributor felt great.
   *  Yes, both in GSoC \& Outreachy. One of my interns went on to finish a PhD in bioinformatics following the GSoC participation!
   *  Yes - supervising summer studentships; I've only been able to do this for one year so far, so it's the only memory‚Ä¶ ;)
   *  Yes, many years ago and the people are what stuck with me the longest
   *  I did many summer internships when I was in college and grad school, and found them very useful. I even got publications out of a few of them! I supervised a summer intern once at my lab.
   *  I have done lab intereships in my BSc and also supervised some during my PhD, but nothing else.


Opening question 2: What brought you to this session today? Are you interested in mentoring an open source intern?

   *  I anticipate chances to mentor interns though several of the open source projects I contribute to.
   *   I also expect to mentor more interns in the future
   *   Interested in the topic, and in particular how to bring biologists without formal training up to speed
   * I try to stay somewhat informed of what is going on in the field, though much of it is over my head
   * As someone who participates in the leadership of two open source organizations, I would like to know how to get more interns/volunteers involved in these projects and how to make them an asset to the organizations rather than just a time drain.
   * I would be interestedin mentoring an intern in the future (once I have tiem for it and feel more confident myself)


## Getting started

All programs:

   * Must be open source code!
   * Must have 2+ community members, and ideally 2+ mentors per project.


### Google Summer of Code

   * [https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
       * Contributor application period: April-May
       * Mentoring period: June-November
       * Full timeline: [https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline)
   * Interns are paid by Google, for projects of either 175 or 350 hours. Pay varies based on the country they're in and cost of living.
   * Org applications closed *yesterday* - but don't panic! If you're interested in participating please contact the OBF, we may be able to add your project in to our umbrella org:
       * [https://www.open-bio.org/2022/01/28/google-summer-of-code-2022-time-for-project-ideas/](https://www.open-bio.org/2022/01/28/google-summer-of-code-2022-time-for-project-ideas/)  
   * Projects \_must\_ be code (not design, not docs, not UX). There is also Google Season of Docs for documentation: [https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs)


### Outreachy

   * [https://www.outreachy.org/](https://www.outreachy.org/)
       * Org applications open for the mid-year round until 25 Feb
       * ‚úçüèø Intern applications are accepted from February 4, 2022 to February 25, 2022 at 4pm UTC
       * üìë Internship project list will be finalized on March 25, 2022
       * üôåüèø Internships run May 30 to August 26, 2022
       * **December 2022 internships:**
       * ‚úçüèø Intern applications are accepted from early August to late August 2022
       * üìë Internship project list will be finalized in early October 2022
       * üôãüèΩ Mentors can sign up starting in late July 2022
       * üôåüèø Internships run early December 2022 to early March 2023
   * Dedicated to helping marginalised people find experience in tech.
   * Requires up-front payment in most cases. Pay is flat rate of $7000 / intern, no matter where they worldwide. To a mentoring org, the cost is $7,500 / intern.
   * There are some ways to get sponsored internship spots for open science projects (CZI and Welcome funding, humanitarian projects).
   * Can be code, code-related (e.g. design, UX, documentation), or open science projects, so long as it's open.


## What to expect if you participate as a mentor

### Time commitments

   * Heaviest: Before / during the intern application period:
       * This can be very time consuming as there are usually far more applicants than spots available. Outreachy requires contributions of some sort (e.g. a pull request to a repo, a logo design, a writing sample, or similar).
       * Try and find a few tasks that can be done repeatedly (example, "pick a single file from this list and refactor it" or "sketch a logo design based on a requirement")
   * Intern selection period: Can be really tough if you have lots of good interns!
   * Intern work period: 2-10 hours per week. Depends on the intern and their experience
       * Start with an easy intern if you haven't done this before!
------

## Question break

   *  do you always rely on being an organisation to be a mentor on these? Like, As a researcher, do I have to involve my University or can I apply as an individual?
       * Yo suggested applying as the software project or research group (not as the unversity as a whole, nor as an individual - you need multiple people for the student to interact with as a community).
   *  Do you recommend the administrator (a clearly defined role on GSoC) be separate from the mentors, or is someone doing both roles realistic? Conflict of interest if you have to pick the students/projects is one concern, but also being overloaded.
       * Yo says with GSoC it is more work, but the timing of the workloads doesn't overlap too badly, so possible. But you would have to be extra careful about COI in picking projects.
   *  Have you any guidance/advice for modulating the time *you'd* take for a project to the time an intern might take for a project?
       * Students have to write a project description incl. time estimates, check with students that it's realistic but also include some optional stretch goals on top of a realisticly acheivable core.
   *  Do you have some recommendation when to favor Outreachy over GSoC (or vice versa) for your own projects?
       * If it fits the GSoC scope, try that one. If it doesn't fit within GSoC then Outreachy
   *  What would you recommend for first-time participants on the mentoring side: joining an umbrella or participating in the program independently?
       * GSoC go for the umbrella route (takes the admin work off your back). For Outreachy, there are less umbrella organisations but Outreachy themselves do have support channels - can ask past mentors for advice.

## Tips and tricks

   * Have guides ready for your applicants, and update them everytime you get a question that is likely to be repeated.
   * You don't have to do it all - consider forking someone else's guide: [https://github.com/intermine/internships](https://github.com/intermine/internships)
   * Have a rubric ready for grading applicants, and record your choices. You may want to get more than one person to review each application.
   * Run community calls for your interns so they feel connected and get to meet people. Here are some possible templates, [https://github.com/yochannah/coding-internship-calls](https://github.com/yochannah/coding-internship-calls) covering
       * Kickoff - interns meet each other, learn about your org and expectations
       * Mid-internship call: Coding good practices, providing feedback, and code review
       * End of internship - careers call? Final group presentations? Other?
